# HorizontalPicker ![Build](https://github.com/AtomicLemon/HorizontalPicker/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Horizontal Picker made for iOS 14 and above, using Swift/SwiftUI

## Example
I'll add a gif soon

## Usage

### Icon Picker:

import HorizontalPicker
HIconScroller(icons: ["pencil", "cloud", "cloud.fill", "moon", "moon.stars", "star", "star.circle", "star.fill", "text.badge.star"])
```

## Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribute to the package, I'm fairly new to the Swift language so I'd say there's a lot to be improved

## Todo:

* Implement dark/light mode support
